# Future Learn MOOC for "Functional Programming in Haskell"


## Introduction
My notes of Future Learn MOOC for [Functional Programming in Haskell: Supercharge Your Coding](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/functional-programming-haskell) by Wim Vanderbauwhede & Jeremy Singer in association with University of Glasgow.<br>
I took this course when it ran the first time between 19th Sep, 2016 till 31st Oct, 2016 [duration of 6 weeks].<br>
The main intention for taking these notes is for a quick reference and revision.

Though there were quizzes on every important topic, there were no hands-on exercises in this course unfortunately, which is a bit of a dampener if you are intending to learn an altogether different language.


## Notes
- [x]  1. [Week 1: "Haskell First Steps"](Week1_Notes.md)
- [x]  2. [Week 2: "Haskell Building Blocks"](Week2_Notes.md)
- [x]  3. [Week 3: "Data Structures And Types"](Week3_Notes.md)
- [ ]  4. Week 4: "When Programs Get Bigger"
- [ ]  5. Week 5: "Hardcore Haskell"
- [ ]  6. Week 6: "Think Like A Functional Programmer"

I also created a note on all the available resources for learning Haskell.
- [x]  7. [Haskell Learning Resources](Haskell_Learning_Resources.md)

All these Markdown notes have their corresponding HTML previews, convenient for reading offline in a browser, without requiring a Markdown editor.
